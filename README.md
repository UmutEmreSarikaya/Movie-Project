# Movie_Project
This project uses https://www.themoviedb.org/ to list popular movies and show their details. Retrofit is used in this project. Hilt is used for dependency injection. 
MVVM architecture is used in the project. Movies also can be searched on another fragment. Any movie can be added to favorite and then can be seen on the favorite
movie fragment. Navigation component is used for navigating between fragments. DiffUtil is used to update the lists on recycler views's adapter.

This project was done during my internship at OBSS Technology.
